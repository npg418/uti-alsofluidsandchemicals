An addon of [UntranslatedItems](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items), that also makes fluids
and chemicals from mekanism mod untranslated!

This mod is inspired by [UntranslatedItems-AlsoFluids](https://github.com/KatatsumuriPan/UntranslatedItems-AlsoFluids/).
Great respect for KatatsumuriPan!

If you want other minecraft versions, other modLoader, or other external mods support, please open [issue](./issue).
