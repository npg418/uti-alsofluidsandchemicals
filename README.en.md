An addon of [UntranslatedItems](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items), that also makes fluids
and chemicals from mekanism mod untranslated!

This mod is inspired by [UntranslatedItems-AlsoFluids](https://github.com/KatatsumuriPan/UntranslatedItems-AlsoFluids/).
Great respect for KatatsumuriPan!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mekanism has breaking change in ChemicalEmiStack after v1.21.1-10.7.11.76. So please use UTI-AFAC v1.2.0 or later.

If you want other minecraft versions, other modLoader, or other external mods support, please
open [issue](https://github.com/npg418/uti-alsofluidsandchemicals/issues).  
(It's hard to support all versions independently, so I'll support the ones in demand.)
